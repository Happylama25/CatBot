# CatBot
This is my first coding project I wrote, it was created so that my friends and others could start and join a Minecraft Server that I had on my PC without me needing to manually start it for them every time.

My goal was to ultimately get more people into joining the server and interacting with eachother and to also cut out the need to manually start servers from the host machine.

I wrote it in Python 3.9 and discord.py
