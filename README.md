# CatBot
This is my first coding project I wrote, it was created so that my friends and others could start and join a Minecraft Server that I had on my PC without me needing to manually start it for them every time.

My goal was to ultimately get more people into joining the server and interacting with each other and to also cut out the need to manually start servers from the host machine.

I started writing it in Python 3.9 and discord.py 1.7.3 but then migrated to Disnake 2.4.0

I then further developed this project to perform an API request to a [Pterodactyl Panel](https://pterodactyl.io/) to start and stop servers/programs remotely through Discord.


and now i just mess about with it when i have the time
